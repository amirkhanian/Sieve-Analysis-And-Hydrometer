# Sieve-Analysis-And-Hydrometer

Sieve analysis and hydrometer lab exercise for an introductory geotechnical course.

This repository serves as a sort of "track-changes" for the laboratory manual. This also allows others to clone the repository for use in systems outside of Overleaf.

The main document template was modified from a NIST document template. The attribution is located in the main.tex file.

Any figures or photographs used in the manual are released under the same license agreement indicated in the document and here on GitHub.

Feedback is appreciated as are commits which fix issues or address deficiencies in the technical content.

## Compiled Version

There is a compiled PDF version of the document in this repository. It has been run through Adobe's accessibility checker and most of the errors have been fixed. It appears that Adobe's checker has some issues with how LaTeX renders the page numbers on some pages.

## Companion Video

There are two companion videos that are designed to be pre-lab activities for students to view prior to coming to lab. In this manner, students will be better prepared to execute the activities as they would have seen the basics of the procedures. The videos are not meant to be a standalone lesson nor a in-depth training exercise.
